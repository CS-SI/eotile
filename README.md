[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.2.6-g)]() [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.6+-blue)]()

Managed Sentinel-2 and Landsat8 tiles


## ‚è¨ Installation

Install the package using pip:
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.cloud-espace.si.c-s.fr/RemoteSensing/eotile.git
cd eotile
pip install .
```

## üî≤ Usage

### üìü Through the CLI
```sh
eotile [input] [output]
```

You can **input** these elements : a file, a tile id, a location, a wkt polygon, a bbox

### To options (Optional):
* `-to_file FILE_PATH`      Write tiles to a *geography* file
* `-to_wkt`               Output the geometry of matching tiles with wkt format on standard output
* `-to_bbox`              Output the bounding box of matching tiles on standard output
* `-to_tile_id`           Output the id(s) of matching tiles on standard output
* `-to_location`          Output the location of the centroid of matching tiles on standard output

### Tiles selection :
* `-no_l8`              output S2 tiles and not the L8 ones
* `-no_s2`              output L8 tiles and not the S2 ones
* `-s2_overlap`         Use S2 tiles with overlap
* `-dem`                Use elevation tiles as well
* `-srtm5x5`            Use specific 5x5 SRTM tiles as well

##### Other options :
* `-epsg`                 Specify the epsg of the input if not WGS84
* `-logger_file LOGGER_FILE_PATH` Redirect information from standard output to a file
* `-location_type {city, county, state, country}` If needed, specify the location type that is requested
                        
* `-threshold THRESHOLD` For large polygons at high resolution, you might want
                        to simplify them using a threshold (0 to 1)
* `-min_overlap MIN_OVERLAP` Minimum percentage of overlap to consider a tile (0 to 1)

### üêç Through the python module

Getting Started :
```python
# Import the module
from eotile import eotile_module 

# Create tile lists
[S2_Tiles, L8_Tiles, DEM_Tiles, SRTM5x5_Tiles] = eotile_module.main("Spain", no_s2=True) 
# Replace Spain with whatever string you might need (a file, a tile id, a location, a wkt polygon, a bbox)

# Returned elements are GeoPandas Dataframes :
print(S2_Tiles.id)

# Iter over the Dataframe :
for tile in L8_Tiles.iterrows():
    print(tile[1].geometry.wkt)

```

You can also use the advanced quicksearch

```python
# Import the module
from eotile.eotile_module import quick_search 

# Create the GeoPandas DataFrame of L8 Tiles corresponding to this S2 Tile id 
gdf = quick_search("31TCJ", "tile_id", "L8")
>>     id                                           geometry
0  198029  POLYGON ((0.84682 44.02364, 0.84638 44.02370, ...
1  199029  POLYGON ((-0.69823 44.02364, -0.69866 44.02370...
2  199030  POLYGON ((-0.86579 42.55300, -1.13296 42.59191...
3  198030  POLYGON ((0.67927 42.55300, 0.41210 42.59191, ...
```
*Note: quick_search uses OGR for a quicker result. This requires a proper installation of GDAL components*
## üîñ Examples

* Using a location
```sh
eotile "Metropolitan France" -threshold 1 -to_tile_id
```
* Using a BBOX
```sh
eotile "0.49593622377, 43.326246335, 1.7661878622, 44.246370915" -no_l8 -logger_file test.log
```
(This line will produce an output under the test.log file)
* Using a wkt
```sh
eotile 'POLYGON ((0.8468214953196805 44.02363566574142, 0.84638 44.0237, 0.8590044453705752 44.06127355906579, 0.8712896362539795 44.09783741052559, 1.325549447552162 45.44983010010615, 1.338016257992888 45.48693449754356, 1.35047 45.524, 1.350948946138455 45.52393017672913, 3.65866 45.1875, 3.644501621308357 45.14977803391441, 3.111537654412643 43.72980975068511, 3.09866 43.6955, 0.8468214953196805 44.02363566574142))' -to_location -no_s2
```
* Using S2 tile ids
```sh
eotile "31TCJ, 31TCE" -to_file data/TLS_tiles.shp
```
* Using a file
```sh
eotile tests/test_data/illinois.shp -no_l8 -vvv
```

* Note that the number of Tiles of S2 without overlap and with overlap is not the same. The difference apparently lies in the Geodesic line break north and south corners. 
  - S2 without overlap: 56686 Tiles
  - S2 with ouverlap:   56984 Tiles
